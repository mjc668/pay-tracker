# Roadmap: Pay Tracker

> Derived from `context/foundation/prd.md` (v1) + auto-researched codebase baseline.
> Edit-in-place; archive when superseded.
> Slices below are listed in dependency order. The "At a glance" table is the index.

## Vision recap

Pay Tracker replaces the household spreadsheet with a web app that automates the
tedious, error-prone parts: each month's payment instance is generated automatically,
the dashboard shows what's upcoming and overdue at a glance, and family members can
mark bills paid from any device. Unlike subscription-based tools (YNAB, Mint), it
runs self-hosted or cloud-hosted with no third-party data sharing and no ongoing cost.
The two rules that distinguish it from a static spreadsheet are automatic status
classification (upcoming / overdue / paid) and automatic recurrence — when a payment
is marked paid, the next period's instance appears with no manual action.

## North star

**S-03: Core payment tracking loop** — the smallest end-to-end slice whose successful
delivery proves the core product hypothesis: create a bill template → see its instance
on the dashboard → mark it paid → watch next month's instance appear automatically,
with no manual intervention. This maps directly to the primary Success Criterion in
the PRD (US-01) and is placed as early as its prerequisites allow because every other
slice only matters if this loop works.

## At a glance

| ID   | Change ID                    | Outcome (user can …)                                                              | Prerequisites | PRD refs                                  | Status   |

## Streams

Navigation aid — groups items that share a Prerequisites chain. Canonical ordering still lives in the dependency graph below; this table is the proposed reading order across parallel tracks.

| Stream | Theme                  | Chain                                      | Note                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A      | Core tracking loop     | `F-01` → `S-01` → `S-02` → `S-03`         | The must-have path to the north star; every other stream branches off this one.                                    |
| B      | Data portability       | `S-01` → `S-04` → `S-08` → `S-09` → `S-18`, `S-19` | S-04 (.xlsx) and S-08 (backup) parallel with S-02; S-09 (import) needs S-08 first. S-18/S-19 harden S-09's restore path — audit follow-up, run in either order.  |
| C      | Ship & deploy          | `S-03` → `S-05`                            | Runs after the north star lands.                                                                                   |
| D      | Localisation           | `S-01` → `S-07`                            | Independent of the core loop; can run in parallel with any other stream after S-01.                               |
| E      | Notifications          | `S-03` → `S-10` · `S-05` → `S-12`         | S-10: email reminders, needs SMTP config. S-12: browser push on due date, client-side only, needs PWA SW.         |
| F      | Security (blocking)    | `F-01` → `S-01` → `S-11`                  | Breaking schema change. Must land before S-09 (restore) — user-scoped restore depends on user-scoped data model.  |

## Baseline

What's already in place in the codebase as of 2026-06-11 (auto-researched + user-confirmed).
Foundations below assume these are present and do NOT re-scaffold them.

- **Frontend:** present — Next.js 16.2.9 + React 19.2.4, App Router, Tailwind CSS; boilerplate only, no reusable components (`frontend/src/app/`)
- **Backend / API:** present — FastAPI with routers for auth, bills, and export (`backend/app/routers/`); entrypoint at `backend/app/main.py`
- **Data:** partial — SQLAlchemy 2.0 models for users and bills (`backend/app/models/`), Alembic configured but migrations folder empty; no migration revision generated yet
- **Auth:** present — custom JWT auth (PyJWT); token creation at `backend/app/core/security.py:19-27`; route protection via `Depends(current_user)` in `backend/app/core/deps.py:13-24`; all bill routes protected
- **Deploy / infra:** partial — `docker-compose.yml` + `frontend/Dockerfile` + `backend/Dockerfile` present; no CI/CD workflows
- **Observability:** absent — no logging library, no error tracking, no metrics configured

## Foundations

### F-01: DB schema migration

- **Outcome:** (foundation) Alembic revision generated and applied; tables for `users`, `bill_templates`, and `payment_instances` exist in the containerized PostgreSQL instance.
- **Change ID:** db-schema-migration
- **PRD refs:** NFR data-persistence ("all payment data is written to a durable database")
- **Unlocks:** S-01 (users table needed for registration), S-02 (bill_templates table needed for template CRUD), S-03 (payment_instances table needed for the tracking loop), S-04 (data must exist to export)
- **Prerequisites:** —
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Sequenced first because every vertical slice is unverifiable without the schema in place. Risk: SQLAlchemy models may not yet cover all columns implied by the business-logic rules (e.g., `paused` flag, `period` key on instances); the migration step will surface any model gaps before UI work begins.
- **Status:** done

## Slices

### S-01: Auth UI

- **Outcome:** user can register with email and password and log in via the Next.js frontend; a valid JWT is stored in the browser and sent on subsequent API calls.
- **Change ID:** auth-ui
- **PRD refs:** FR-001, FR-002
- **Prerequisites:** F-01 (users table must exist)
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Backend auth is fully wired (JWT issuance, route protection); this slice is frontend-only — register page, login page, token storage, and redirect guard. Low risk. Sequenced before template and payment work because every other slice requires an authenticated session.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-02: Bill template management

- **Outcome:** user can create a bill template (name, amount, category, due day, recurrence type, paused flag), edit an existing template, and archive one (hidden from active view; history preserved).
- **Change ID:** bill-template-management
- **PRD refs:** FR-003, FR-004, FR-005
- **Prerequisites:** S-01 (authenticated session required to call template API)
- **Parallel with:** S-04 (export backend already exists; export frontend can be built alongside template UI)
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Backend bills router is already scaffolded (`backend/app/routers/bills.py`, 112 lines); this slice is primarily a frontend CRUD form and list. Sequenced before the payment loop (S-03) because instances cannot be generated without templates. Main risk: the "paused" flag and "archive" soft-delete semantics must be wired consistently between model, API, and UI — an inconsistency here would break FR-009 suppression logic downstream.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-03: Core payment tracking loop *(north star)*

- **Outcome:** user can view a unified payment list sorted by due date with status indicators (upcoming / overdue / paid), mark a payment instance as paid with the amount defaulting to the template amount (overridable), and watch the next month's instance appear automatically on the dashboard — with no manual action required.
- **Change ID:** core-payment-tracking-loop
- **PRD refs:** US-01, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008, FR-009
- **Prerequisites:** S-01 (auth), S-02 (templates must exist for instances to be generated)
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Does `backend/app/services/recurrence.py` already implement FR-006 (idempotent instance generation) and FR-009 (auto-create next period on paid)? — Owner: user. Block: no (planning can proceed; implementation will read the file and complete or extend it).
- **Risk:** This is the most complex slice — it exercises the two domain rules simultaneously (status classification + recurrence automation). The idempotency key `(bill_id, period)` must be enforced at the DB constraint level to prevent duplicate instances at month boundaries (see AGENTS.md hard rule). Sequenced after template management because instances are derived from templates.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-04: .xlsx export

- **Outcome:** user can export all payment history to a downloadable `.xlsx` spreadsheet file directly from the dashboard.
- **Change ID:** xlsx-export
- **PRD refs:** FR-010
- **Prerequisites:** S-01 (authenticated session required to access export endpoints)
- **Parallel with:** S-02, S-08 (backend export router already exists at `backend/app/routers/export.py`; frontend trigger is the only remaining work)
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Backend export is already scaffolded; this slice adds the frontend download button and verifies the `.xlsx` output is correct and complete. Low risk.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-05: PWA installability

- **Outcome:** user can install the app from the browser as a Progressive Web App on both mobile and desktop; all primary views are fully operable on 375px-wide screens without pinch-zoom.
- **Change ID:** pwa-installability
- **PRD refs:** FR-013
- **Prerequisites:** S-03 (the core app must be functional before PWA installation is meaningful to verify)
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Local-mode PWA requires HTTPS; self-hosted deployments need a reverse-proxy or self-signed cert. Guidance deferred to deployment docs. — Owner: implementation team. Block: no (does not affect core PWA configuration).
- **Risk:** Next.js supports PWA via `next-pwa` or a custom service worker; the manifest and service worker are configuration work. Mobile usability (375px layouts) should be addressed incrementally during S-01–S-04 but final verification is here. Low risk if layouts are kept simple throughout.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-07: Language support

- **Outcome:** user can switch the UI between English and Polish via a toggle in the dashboard nav bar; the selected language is detected automatically from the browser on first use and restored from the user's account on subsequent logins.
- **Change ID:** language-support
- **PRD refs:** FR-016, FR-017
- **Prerequisites:** S-01 (per-user persistence requires auth and a `/auth/me` endpoint built on the existing JWT infrastructure)
- **Parallel with:** S-02, S-03, S-04, S-05, S-06 — no data dependencies on any other slice
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** All ~80 user-visible strings must be extracted from 13 files; a missing translation key causes a runtime error in next-intl, so message files must be complete before Phase 3 ships. Plan is at `context/changes/language-support/plan.md`.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-08: JSON backup

- **Outcome:** user can download a full machine-readable JSON backup of all bill templates and payment history from the dashboard.
- **Change ID:** data-backup
- **PRD refs:** FR-011
- **Prerequisites:** S-01 (authenticated session required)
- **Parallel with:** S-04 (both use the existing export router; can be built in the same pass or separately)
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Backend endpoint may already be scaffolded in `export.py`; verify coverage before planning. Low risk.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-11: Per-user data scoping *(security — blocking)*

- **Outcome:** each user can only see and manage their own bill templates and payment instances; User A cannot read, create, update, or delete User B's data under any circumstance.
- **Change ID:** per-user-data-scoping
- **PRD refs:** FR-020
- **Prerequisites:** F-01 (schema), S-01 (auth / `current_user`)
- **Parallel with:** nothing — this is a breaking schema change; all bill/payment work is blocked until this lands
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Migration strategy for existing rows — existing `BillTemplate` rows have no `user_id`. The migration must either assign them to a single owner or truncate. Decision must be made during planning. — Owner: user. Block: yes (migration cannot run without this decision).
- **Risk:** Breaking change. Requires: (1) Alembic migration to add non-nullable `user_id` FK on `BillTemplate`; (2) all bill router queries filtered by `current_user.id`; (3) all export/backup endpoints scoped to `current_user.id`; (4) recurrence service must never touch another user's templates. A missed filter is a data-leak bug — each router endpoint must be audited individually. PaymentInstance does NOT need a direct `user_id` column — scope is inherited transitively via `bill_id → BillTemplate.user_id`.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-09: Restore from backup file

- **Outcome:** user can upload a JSON backup file and restore all bill templates and payment history from it; existing data is replaced or merged (strategy TBD at plan time).
- **Change ID:** data-restore
- **PRD refs:** FR-018 (new — add to PRD)
- **Prerequisites:** S-08 (backup format must be stable before import can be implemented)
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Replace-all vs. merge strategy — destructive restore resets the DB; merge strategy preserves existing records. Must be decided during `/10x-plan data-restore`. — Owner: user. Block: no (planning can proceed with both options on the table).
  - Auth guard for import — import is a destructive admin-level action; must confirm whether the existing `current_user` dependency is sufficient or a confirmation step is needed.
- **Risk:** Most complex of the three data-portability slices. A destructive import without adequate confirmation or a transaction rollback path could result in data loss. Plan must include a dry-run or confirmation gate.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-12: Browser notifications

- **Outcome:** user gets one browser notification per unpaid bill due today each time the dashboard is opened; notifications require one-time permission grant via a Bell icon in the dashboard header.
- **Change ID:** browser-notification
- **PRD refs:** FR-013 (extension — PWA notification capability)
- **Prerequisites:** S-05 (service worker must be registered for `showNotification()`)
- **Parallel with:** S-10 (independent notification channel; no shared dependencies)
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Client-side only; no backend changes. iOS requires app installed as PWA (Add to Home Screen) and iOS 16.4+ — silently no-ops on older versions. Dedup via localStorage so repeated page loads don't spam the user. Low risk overall.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-10: Email reminders

- **Outcome:** user receives an email reminder N days before a bill's due date when the instance is still unpaid; the lead time is configurable per template or globally.
- **Change ID:** email-reminders
- **PRD refs:** FR-012
- **Prerequisites:** S-03 (payment instances must exist to trigger reminders)
- **Parallel with:** S-04, S-08, S-09 (no data dependencies on export/import)
- **Blockers:** SMTP provider and credentials must be configured in the deployment environment before this slice can be verified end-to-end.
- **Unknowns:**
  - SMTP provider — Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun, or self-hosted (Postfix). Choice affects the backend library and credential format. Must be decided before `/10x-plan email-reminders`. — Owner: user. Block: no (implementation can be provider-agnostic via SMTP; provider is a deployment concern).
  - Reminder timing — how many days before due date? Fixed value (e.g., 3 days) or per-template setting? — Owner: user. Block: no (default to a fixed configurable value; per-template setting can be added later).
  - Delivery mechanism — a scheduled background job (APScheduler or a cron container) or a queue (Celery + Redis). Scheduled job is simpler; queue is more robust under load. — Owner: implementation team. Block: no (APScheduler embedded in FastAPI is sufficient for a household-scale app).
- **Risk:** Adds a background scheduler and an external SMTP dependency — both are new infrastructure for this project. Main risk is silent delivery failures (bounces, spam filtering) that are hard to detect without logging or a delivery webhook. Plan must include a delivery log table or at minimum structured logging per send attempt.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-13: Settings page

- **Outcome:** user can manage their account (email, password), configure email reminder timing (2 days before / 1 day before / on day / 1 day after), enable/disable browser notifications, and trigger backup and restore — all from a single dedicated Settings page accessible via a gear icon in the nav header. The crowded header icon buttons are removed.
- **Change ID:** settings-page
- **PRD refs:** FR-001 (profile), FR-011 (backup), FR-012 (email reminders), FR-013 (browser notifications), FR-018 (restore)
- **Prerequisites:** S-10 (email reminder infrastructure), S-12 (browser notification hook)
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Email reminder timing adds 4 new User model columns and tightens the `reminder_sent_overdue` semantics from "any overdue" to "exactly 1 day after due" — a behavioral change for existing users. Migration defaults `notify_1_day_before = True` to preserve prior behavior. Plan at `context/changes/settings-page/plan.md`.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-15: Category enum & grouping

- **Outcome:** user sees bills (active and archived) and payments grouped under predefined category headers (Housing, Utilities, Insurance, Subscriptions, Entertainment, Transport, Healthcare, Education, Other); category is a required field on every bill template, selected from a fixed `<select>` instead of a free-text input.
- **Change ID:** category-enum-grouping
- **PRD refs:** FR-003, FR-005 (bill template management — category field)
- **Prerequisites:** S-02 (bill templates must exist), S-07 (i18n infrastructure required for translated category labels)
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Requires a hand-written Alembic migration (per lessons.md — autogenerate is unreliable for column type/nullability changes); the migration promotes `category` from nullable `VARCHAR(100)` to `NOT NULL VARCHAR(50)`. Old backup files with free-text category strings are handled gracefully (coerced to `"other"` on restore). Plan at `context/changes/category-enum-grouping/plan.md`.
- **Status:** done

### S-17: Password reset

- **Outcome:** user can request a password reset link by email when they forget their password; receive a secure one-time link; and set a new password via that link, with the token expiring after a configurable number of minutes.
- **Change ID:** reset-password
- **PRD refs:** FR-002 (extension — authentication)
- **Prerequisites:** S-01 (auth infrastructure), S-10 (SMTP infrastructure for sending email)
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Email enumeration prevention required — endpoint must return the same 200 response regardless of whether the email is registered. SMTP failures must not propagate as 500. Token stored as SHA-256 hash; single-use; configurable expiry via `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-18: Restore safety comparison

- **Outcome:** before confirming a restore, the user sees a comparison of their current data against the backup file being uploaded — bill count, payment count, and the backup's export date — plus a visual warning if the backup has fewer bills or payments than current data (the specific failure mode: restoring a stale backup silently discards newer history).
- **Change ID:** restore-safety-comparison
- **PRD refs:** FR-018 (extension — restore)
- **Prerequisites:** S-09 (restore endpoint and backup schema must exist)
- **Parallel with:** S-19 (independent enhancement to the same restore flow; can ship in either order or together)
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Additive, frontend-driven change. Adds one new lightweight backend endpoint (`GET /export/summary`, count-only, scoped to `current_user`) plus client-side JSON parsing of the picked file before the existing confirmation dialog. Does not change `POST /export/restore`'s destructive replace semantics — it only helps the user avoid triggering it by mistake. Backups with no `exported_at` (schema_version 2) fall back to an "export date unknown" label rather than blocking.
- **Status:** done

---

### S-19: Restore auto-backup safety net

- **Outcome:** immediately before a restore executes its destructive delete-and-replace, the server automatically snapshots the user's current data, so that data can be recovered if the restore turns out to have been a mistake — a safety net that holds even if the user proceeds past the S-18 warning, or if the request bypasses the UI entirely (e.g. direct API call).
- **Change ID:** restore-auto-backup-safety-net
- **PRD refs:** FR-018 (extension — restore)
- **Prerequisites:** S-09 (restore endpoint must exist)
- **Parallel with:** S-18 (independent enhancement to the same restore flow; can ship in either order or together)
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Snapshot storage and retention — where the pre-restore snapshot is kept (e.g. a temporary DB table, an object-storage blob, a downloadable response artifact) and how long it's retained before being discarded. Must be decided during planning. — Owner: user. Block: no (planning can proceed with options on the table).
  - Recovery path — whether the user self-serves recovery (e.g. a "last snapshot" download button) or it's an operator/support-only recovery mechanism. Affects scope significantly. — Owner: user. Block: no.
- **Risk:** More complex than S-18 — it's a backend-only safety mechanism with its own storage and retention lifecycle, and needs its own test coverage (snapshot taken, snapshot survives restore, snapshot scoped correctly per user). Must not slow down or partially fail the restore transaction itself.
- **Status:** done

## Infrastructure

### I-01: Extract PostgreSQL into its own Docker Compose service

- **Outcome:** PostgreSQL 17 runs in its own `postgres` service using the official image; the backend image contains only Python + app code; the two processes can be restarted and observed independently.
- **Change ID:** postgres-service-extract
- **PRD refs:** — (not a functional requirement; DevOps hygiene)
- **Prerequisites:** —
- **Parallel with:** any slice (no app logic changes)
- **Risk:** Fresh-volume start required (`docker compose down -v`); local dev data is lost. Backend `DATABASE_URL` env override in compose points to the `postgres` service name — must not be confused with the `localhost:5432` default in `.env`.
- **Status:** done

## Open Roadmap Questions

None open. (Question 1, Local-mode PWA and HTTPS, was resolved 2026-09-22 — see `infrastructure.md` § HTTPS & PWA deployment for Caddy, nginx + Certbot, and Cloudflare setups.)

## Parked

- **CI/CD pipeline** — Shipped 2026-06-15. GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: frontend build + lint, backend black format check, backend tests placeholder, Docker smoke test (build → up → health check → down). Not an FR; infrastructure polish.
- **Budgeting and savings goals** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. Out of scope for v1.
- **Bank / card integrations** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. No automatic transaction import of any kind.
- **Multi-household / SaaS mode** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. One household per deployment instance.
- **Native mobile app** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. PWA is the mobile story.

## Done

- **F-01: (foundation) DB schema migrated to head; tables for users, bill_templates, payment_instances exist** — Archived 2026-06-11 → `context/archive/2026-06-11-db-schema-migration/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-01: user can register with email and password and log in via the Next.js frontend; a valid JWT is stored in the browser and sent on subsequent API calls.** — Archived 2026-06-12 → `context/archive/2026-06-12-auth-ui/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-02: create, edit, and archive bill templates via UI** — Archived 2026-06-12 → `context/archive/2026-06-12-bill-template-management/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-07: user can switch the UI between English and Polish via a toggle in the dashboard nav bar; the selected language is detected automatically from the browser on first use and restored from the user's account on subsequent logins.** — Archived 2026-06-12 → `context/archive/2026-06-12-language-support/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-03: user can view a unified payment list sorted by due date with status indicators (upcoming / overdue / paid), mark a payment instance as paid with the amount defaulting to the template amount (overridable), and watch the next month's instance appear automatically on the dashboard** — Archived 2026-06-12 → `context/archive/2026-06-12-core-payment-tracking-loop/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-04: user can export all payment history to a downloadable .xlsx spreadsheet file directly from the dashboard** — Archived 2026-06-15 → `context/archive/2026-06-13-xlsx-export/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-05: install the app from the browser on mobile and desktop** — Archived 2026-06-15 → `context/archive/2026-06-15-pwa-installability/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-08: download a full JSON backup of all templates and payment history** — Archived 2026-06-15 → `context/archive/2026-06-15-data-backup/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-11: only see own bills and payments; User A cannot access User B's data** — Archived 2026-06-15 → `context/archive/2026-06-15-per-user-data-scoping/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-09: upload a JSON backup and restore all data from it** — Archived 2026-06-15 → `context/archive/2026-06-15-data-restore/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-12: user gets one browser notification per unpaid bill due today each time the dashboard is opened; notifications require one-time permission grant via a Bell icon in the dashboard header.** — Archived 2026-06-15 → `context/archive/2026-06-15-browser-notification/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-10: user receives an email reminder N days before a bill's due date when the instance is still unpaid; the lead time is configurable per template or globally.** — Archived 2026-06-16 → `context/archive/2026-06-16-email-reminders/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-13: user can manage their account (email, password), configure email reminder timing (2 days before / 1 day before / on day / 1 day after), enable/disable browser notifications, and trigger backup and restore — all from a single dedicated Settings page accessible via a gear icon in the nav header. The crowded header icon buttons are removed.** — Archived 2026-06-16 → `context/archive/2026-06-16-settings-page/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-15: user sees bills and payments grouped under predefined category headers (Housing, Utilities, Insurance, Subscriptions, Entertainment, Transport, Healthcare, Education, Other); category is a required field on every bill template, selected from a fixed `<select>` instead of a free-text input.** — Archived 2026-06-19 → `context/archive/2026-06-19-category-enum-grouping/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-16: user receives a full month-end summary email showing what was paid (amount due vs. paid, date) and what was missed/overdue, with totals; toggle and on-demand send button in Settings → Email Notifications.** — Archived 2026-06-23 → `context/archive/2026-06-23-monthly-summary-email/`. Lesson: —.
- **I-01: PostgreSQL 17 runs in its own `postgres` service using the official image; the backend image contains only Python + app code; the two processes can be restarted and observed independently.** — Archived 2026-06-24 → `context/archive/2026-06-24-postgres-service-extract/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-17: user can request a password reset link by email; receive a secure one-time link; and set a new password via that link.** — Archived 2026-06-24 → `context/archive/2026-06-24-reset-password/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-18: before confirming a restore, the user sees a comparison of their current data against the backup file being uploaded — bill count, payment count, and the backup's export date — plus a visual warning if the backup has fewer bills or payments than current data.** — Archived 2026-07-10 → `context/archive/2026-07-10-restore-safety-comparison/`. Lesson: —.
- **S-19: immediately before a restore executes its destructive delete-and-replace, the server automatically snapshots the user's current data, so that data can be recovered if the restore turns out to have been a mistake — a safety net that holds even if the user proceeds past the S-18 warning, or if the request bypasses the UI entirely (e.g. direct API call).** — Archived 2026-07-10 → `context/archive/2026-07-10-restore-auto-backup-safety-net/`. Lesson: —.
